Writing a [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub) hub (publisher) can be tricky, especially since subscribers also need to have their own public callback urls.

We've developed a testing site that any hub developer can use to run a few automated WebSub scenarios against their hub.  The site serves as the subscriber side, allowing you to see the flow from both perspectives.

Hope that helps!
